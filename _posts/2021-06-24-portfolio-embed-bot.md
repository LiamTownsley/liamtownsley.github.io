# Embed Bot
This was a bot I created for a commission, the purpose of this bot is to generate embeds after asking the user a series of questions.
As this was a commission, it is closed-source, however you can see how it works below:

What was done here?
It would ask from a list of questions, it would validate your answer and if it was a valid answer for that question, it would continue to the next one.
If it was not a valid answer, it would repeat that question until it was valid.
