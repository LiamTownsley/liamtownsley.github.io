# PayPal Invoicing
Why spend time waiting for the customer to send the money to you and have them copy and paste the e-mail when they can just click on an automatically generated invoice and pay the order in full with an optional tip.

# Reaction Tickets
You want to create a commission, apply for staff or get support? Why type, when you can just click a reaction!
