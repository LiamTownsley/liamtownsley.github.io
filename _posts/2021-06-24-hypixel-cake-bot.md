# Caching
All the results are cached, so that the response time is very quick and does not take as long to get the data.

# Showing Cake Prices
You can view the BIN (Buy It Now) prices for certain year New Year Cakes currently on the Hypixel Auction House.

# Detailed Information
Using another command, you can get the median prices of previously-sold cakes, using a custom database of archived cakes, as Hypixel only shows you the last 60 seconds of auctions.
